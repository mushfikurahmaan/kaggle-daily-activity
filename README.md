# Kaggle Daily Activity

This repo is used to maintain my daily Kaggle activity streak.

It contains a simple Jupyter notebook that is updated daily via GitHub Actions and synced to a Kaggle notebook.

## Automation

- GitHub Actions runs every day.
- It updates the notebook timestamp.
- Kaggle detects the change and refreshes the notebook.
